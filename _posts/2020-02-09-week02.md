**Benefits of contributing to open source project**

After learning the basics of FOSS, I would like to contribute to an open source project that’s written in C++ during this semester. I might check its issue tracker if there’s one and look for current issues. Maybe check how other members in the community deal with that issue and build on it. As of now, I only know the general ideas on how to contribute to an open source project. Maybe after looking couple examples of project I will have more ideas.

There are many benefits of contributing to open source project. First, you will know the importance of reading and understanding license and set of rules/guidelines by heart. This helps you develop a good habit of respecting copyright and pay attention to the rules or standards that you must follow. When you join the communication channel of certain open source project, it’s a great opportunity to expand your network of contacts. Since the communication channels can be asynchronous, people from different parts of the world can participate, which means you can talk to and work with someone from the other side of the world without going to his/her country. The fact that you can contribute to open source project with and without coding. You can meet and communicate people from all skills set not just developer. The communication channels might lead to an opportunity for job offer, invitation for a conference or a special event.

It’s always good to practice your coding skill or debugging skill with free guidance from professional people. It’s a great opportunity to see how other people generate their project ideas and their coding style. Through this collaborative process, the less experienced contributor gains a deeper understanding of the system’s structure and functions. This also help you starting your own open source project. Maybe you have an idea, but not sure how to implement it, there are people who’s there to help. There are companies that have their works done by hundreds or thousands of developers even if they only have a few developers on staff.

Each line of the code that you contribute to an open source project is publicly accessible. With that being said, you can show them during an interview, or an employer can reach out for you if they would like to hire you. By contributing to an open source project gives you a real experience before landing a tech internship or a real job.
