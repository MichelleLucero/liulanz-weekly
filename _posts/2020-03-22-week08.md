 I noticed that there are differences between the Chinese edition and the English edition of Wikipedia articles. I thought it might be a good way to contribute by incorpriating the differnces on the English edition of Wikipedia. This week I [added release date column under television series and filled in the dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xiao_Zhan&oldid=946476858) based on [the Chinese edition of Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%82%96%E6%88%B0) for a Chinese actor. Last week I inserted an image through the search bar. However, the search bar didn't have enough most recent images, and it will always tell me "No result found" if I typed in a more descriptive topic. My plan was to insert an image of a Huawei phone on [Huawei wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei), and I did find a related image on Wikimedia Commons. I remembered from the lecture that everything on Wikimedia Commons is FREE, which means I should be able to use the image from this website on Wikipedia. The video [Wikipedia editing basics: Uploading and adding images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAy_kBBqs0U) demonstrated me step by step on how to upload image on Wikimedia as well as how to use the Thumbnail link on Wiki. As a result, I [inserted an image of Huawei Mate 20 Pro (Mainland China version) black](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huawei&oldid=946479052) from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Huawei_Mate_20_Pro_(Mainland_China_version)_black.jpg).
