First Week for Remote class

Switching to Virtual Learning
---

I personally think that the remote class is working well. I have no difficulty transitioning from physical lecture to online lecture. For this class particularly, I get to see professor's screen more clearly since I don't have to sit all the way in the back of the classroom. I don't have any sibling, and I'm only living with my mom, so there's not that many of distractions or noise in my house. However, being able to staying home, I tend to procrastinate more. I often neglect the time, so I have to set up alarms and write a to-do list if necessary to avoid forgetting any important due dates or exam date. I also find myself not about to concentrate during the day time. I tend to over relaxed myself by not having the motivation to do work and overly relying on my phone. As a result, I set up a 5:35 AM alarm everyday. I will try to get some work done in the morning when it's extremely quiet. 

I have UTA shifts right after the class, so I never get to meet with my group right after the class. Since now that everything is online, whenever I'm chill during my shift, I can also text them and discuss the project. We've also figured out how to collab through remote communication.


Project

**[March 20, 2020] 1:00PM** -- Our team had a first online group discussion on Skype. We tested out the voice call and shared-screens. Everything is working well. It lasted about 2 hours. Shania explained us some basic concepts in Next.js such as Node.js, React, regular javascript, and the difference between Next.js and Gatsby. We also talk about our progress on watching the [Next.js crash course video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkOVe40Sy0U). We also found a [Next.js Handbook on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/). Since there aren't many resource links for new comer on the repo, we had to search them separately online. We also added more issues to our list on google docs. For example, [Add Testing guide to documentation #10967](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/10967), [More inclusive documentation for next.js #9537](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/95370), and [Request: example for redux toolkit](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/11097). Last, we have "invaded" to their [online communication channel on Spectrum.chat](https://spectrum.chat/next-js?tab=chat). I said "invade" because the link to the channel was found under a post in the [Discussions](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/discussions).

Many of them are labeled as "good first issue", yet they are pretty involved and not easy to start. I came up with the idea to look at last semester's students' project contributions, so we know what kind of different contributions can be done for a big project. I looked at couple students' contribution pages. I saw [someone made a contribution by fixing some grammatical mistakes](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/rajsukanya-weekly/blob/gh-pages/contributions.md), [someone provide assistance to a given issue](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/Bakainkorp-weekly/blob/gh-pages/contributions.md), and [someone is fixing a typo on a file](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/ValeroM-weekly/blob/gh-pages/contributions.md). Overall, I realized that the project contribution doesn't have to be big. It can be as small as fixing a typo, and it can also be a bit challenging by adding implementations to the project.


**As a group, we've decided couple ways to contribute to the project (other than resolving the issues):**

- Learning more about building Next.js applications so we can volunteer or participate in their online community channel
- Asking questions in the group channel
- Adding project examples 
- Add in-code documentation (first we have to understand code)
- write Thank you notes		
- Adding those useful resource links that we found on repo (i.e. video, handbook, and links to their online community chat channel)
- Maybe creating a Wikipedia page for Next.js


Contribution

 I noticed that there are differences between the Chinese edition and the English edition of Wikipedia articles. I thought it might be a good way to contribute by incorpriating the differnces on the English edition of Wikipedia. This week I [added release date column under television series and filled in the dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xiao_Zhan&oldid=946476858) based on [the Chinese edition of Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%82%96%E6%88%B0) for a Chinese actor. Last week I inserted an image through the search bar. However, the search bar didn't have enough most recent images, and it will always tell me "No result found" if I typed in a more descriptive topic. My plan was to insert an image of a Huawei phone on [Huawei wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei), and I did find a related image on Wikimedia Commons. I remembered from the lecture that everything on Wikimedia Commons is FREE, which means I should be able to use the image from this website on Wikipedia. The video [Wikipedia editing basics: Uploading and adding images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAy_kBBqs0U) demonstrated me step by step on how to upload image on Wikimedia as well as how to use the Thumbnail link on Wiki. As a result, I [inserted an image of Huawei Mate 20 Pro (Mainland China version) black](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Huawei&oldid=946479052) from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Huawei_Mate_20_Pro_(Mainland_China_version)_black.jpg).
