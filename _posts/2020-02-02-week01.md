**Why am I here?**
Why did I decide to take a course in open source software?
---

I chose this course mainly is because it fits my schedule the best. I didn't know much about open source software, so it's never a bad thing to learn something new. When I look at the syllabus of this class, I saw many new topics that I've never heard before. This would be a chance for me to increase my understanding of software in real world more than just coding class project. The fact that I haven't had a chance to work as a tech intern, I think this is a great opportunity to learn about how other people contribute coding or non-coding skill to the real world.
